                    <p>I have been interested in working with computers since I was a child. And even though I may not currently study at a
                    higher education level that is directly related to computers, I am currently seeking knowledge and studying in this
                    field. For example, I can edit photos and videos. I can learn how to write code that creates websites. Additionally, I
                    can still use a variety of computer software programs. Whether it's a geographic software program used to create maps, a
                    Google Earth Pro program that can access data and add various information to maps.
                    At present, I have a wide variety of computer knowledge and although the knowledge I have now may not be as great as
                    that of professionals and people who have studied specifically in this field, I have tried and tried. I am very
                    interested in the development of this matter. I hope that in the future I will be able to work directly in this line of
                    work, whether as a librarian or as an information specialist. or anything related to technology, I am determined and
                    persistent and can work with pride in myself.
